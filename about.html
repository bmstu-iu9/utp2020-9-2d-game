    <h1>Fighting</h1>
  <p>This game is about a boy, who was studying programming, but didn't like it.
   Once he was bitten by a radioactive compiler who 
   looked like a cat with a computer monitor on his head.
   So at first he didn't feel so well but in the morning he finds 
   out that he has got programming skills so he had even  made 
   an operating system while he was sleeping.
   So now he doesn't have problems in his studyings.
   But suddenly during the lesson something blows up outside.
   So he runs out and sees 4 guys are going to attack him.</p>
